The solution involves ensuring that the previous value of `myString` is released before assigning a new value. Here's the corrected code:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = nil; // Release previous string
    self.myString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello, world!"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

By setting `self.myString = nil;` before the new assignment, the retain count of the old string decrements, allowing for proper memory management.  This simple fix prevents memory leaks and ensures the application's stability, especially under heavy load or with frequently called methods.
